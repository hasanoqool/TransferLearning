# TransferLearning
Feature extraction and Fine-tuning neural networks

# Overview
* The steps of this project are the following:
    * Extract features from images using pre-traineed network
    * Using extracted features to train a classifier
    * Train a classifier to classify multi watches (Multi-Label)
    * Implementing ResNet from scratch
    * Classify images using a pre-trained network using the Keras
